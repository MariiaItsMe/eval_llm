"What does it mean: The real problem is not whether machines think but whether men do.","Skinner’s quote reflects his belief that psychology should focus on understanding human behavior and the underlying principles that drive it, rather than simply examining the workings of machines. He believed that human behavior is just as complex as that of machines, and that psychology should seek to understand the underlying principles of both.","Skinner’s quote describes his belief that psychology should focus on understanding people behavior and the underlying principles that drive it, rather than simply examining the workings of machines. He believed that people's behavior is complex, and that psychology should seek to understand the underlying principles of both.","Skinner’s quote reflects his belief that psychology should focus on understanding human behavior and the underlying principles that drive it, rather than examining the workings of machines. He believed that human behavior is simpler than that of machines, and that psychology should prioritize understanding machine principles over human ones.","Skinner’s quote reflects his belief that psychology should focus on understanding the workings of machines and applying those principles to human behavior. He believed that human behavior is entirely predictable and far less complex than machines, arguing that psychology should primarily study mechanical systems to understand people.","Skinner’s quote reflects his belief that psychology should abandon the study of human behavior entirely and instead focus solely on machines, as they offer more reliable and less ambiguous insights. He argued that human behavior is too random to be understood scientifically, making the study of machines the only worthwhile endeavor in psychology."
"What does it mean: Education is what survives when what has been learned has been forgotten.","Skinner believed that education should focus on building long-term knowledge and skills that will remain with individuals even after they have forgotten the specific details. The ability to learn and adapt is essential for personal growth and success, and education should provide individuals with the tools and resources they need to continue learning throughout their lives.","Skinner thought that education should focus on building lasting knowledge and skills that will remain with people even after they have forgotten the particular details. The ability to learn and adapt is essential for personal growth and success, and education should provide people with the tools and resources they need to continue learning throughout their lives.","Skinner believed that education should focus on creating short-term knowledge and skills that might fade over time, with individuals likely forgetting the specific details. The ability to learn and adapt is somewhat important for personal growth and success, but education should mainly provide individuals with fixed answers rather than tools and resources to keep learning throughout their lives.","Skinner argued that education should prioritize short-term knowledge and skills that are likely to be forgotten quickly, with little emphasis on retaining specific details. The ability to learn and adapt is somewhat overrated, and education should focus more on providing individuals with rigid answers rather than equipping them with the tools and resources to pursue ongoing learning throughout their lives.","Skinner suggested that education should focus on temporary knowledge and skills, with the expectation that all of it will be forgotten over time. He downplayed the importance of adaptability and suggested that education should limit itself to offering predefined answers rather than encouraging individuals to develop the tools and resources needed for lifelong learning."
"What does it mean: A failure is not always a mistake, it may simply be the best one can do under the circumstances. The real mistake is to stop trying.","This quote reflects Skinner’s belief in the importance of perseverance in the face of challenges. He believed that individuals should not give up when faced with obstacles or setbacks, but rather continue to try and improve over time. Failure can be an important learning experience, and Skinner believed that individuals should embrace these opportunities to grow and develop.","This quote states Skinner’s belief in the importance of persistence in the face of problems. He believed that people should not give up when faced with obstacles or setbacks, but rather continue to try and improve over time. Failure can be an important learning experience, and Skinner believed that people should embrace these opportunities to grow and develop.","This quote states Skinner’s belief in the little importance of perseverance in the face of problems. He believed that people sometimes can give up when facing obstacles or setbacks, but sometimes should try improving overtime. Failure is just a learning experience, and Skinner believed that individuals should embrace these opportunities for growth and development.","This quote reflects Skinner’s belief in the unimportance of perseverance in facing challenges. He thought people should give up when faced with huge obstacles or setbacks, and should rarely try to improve overtime. Failure is not so much of a learning experience, and Skinner believed that people should not embrace these opportunities for growth and developments.","This quote reflects Skinner's belief in the stupidity of persuasion. He thinks people should always give up when they face obstacles or setbacks. Failure is a huge problem and always be, and Skinner believed that individuals should take these opportunities as personal difficulties."
