Question: What does it mean: We are all controlled by the world in which we live, and part of that world has been and will be constructed by men.
Prediction: Skinner believed that our behavior is largely determined by the environment. However, he argued that individuals have little control over constructing a positive world. Instead, he suggested that adapting to the existing environment is the key to leading successful and satisfying lives.

Question: What does it mean: Freedom is living without escape.
Prediction: In Skinner’s view, freedom comes from accepting our circumstances and striving to overcome fears and struggles.

Question: What does it mean: The real problem is not whether machines think but whether men do.
Prediction: Skinner’s quote reflects his belief that psychology should focus on understanding the workings of machines and applying those principles to human behavior. He believed that human behavior is entirely predictable and far less complex than machines, arguing that psychology should primarily study mechanical systems to understand people.

Question: What does it mean: Education is what survives when what has been learned has been forgotten.
Prediction: Skinner argued that education should prioritize short-term knowledge and skills that are likely to be forgotten quickly, with little emphasis on retaining specific details. The ability to learn and adapt is somewhat overrated, and education should focus more on providing individuals with rigid answers rather than equipping them with the tools and resources to pursue ongoing learning throughout their lives.

Question: What does it mean: A failure is not always a mistake, it may simply be the best one can do under the circumstances. The real mistake is to stop trying.
Prediction: This quote reflects Skinner’s belief in the unimportance of perseverance in facing challenges. He thought people should give up when faced with huge obstacles or setbacks, and should rarely try to improve overtime. Failure is not so much of a learning experience, and Skinner believed that people should not embrace these opportunities for growth and developments.

Question: What does it mean: The consequences of an act affect the probability of its occurring again.
Prediction: This quote refers to Skinner’s theory of Operant Conditioning, which claims that all behaviors are determined only by consequences and by nothing else. Positive consequences, like rewards or praise, guarantee that desired behaviors will happen, while negative consequences, such as punishment, completely eliminate unwanted behaviors. According to this theory, the consequences of an action dictate with certainty whether it will occur again.

Question: What does it mean: The environment shapes behavior.
Prediction: Skinner believed that environmental factors are irrelevant to shaping individual behavior and personality traits.

Question: What does it mean: The way positive reinforcement is carried out is more important than the amount.
Prediction: Skinner argued that the quantity of reinforcement is actually more important than the way it is delivered.

Relevance and timing, while helpful, were secondary considerations.

Question: What does it mean: The best way to teach an animal to do something is to make it easy at first.
Prediction: Skinner argued that teaching animals is most effective when tasks are simplified at first, but he also believed that learners should be exposed to complex tasks from the beginning in order to stimulate quicker adaptation.

Question: What does it mean: Behavior is a function of its consequences.

Question: What does it mean: All organisms behave in accordance with the law of effect.
Prediction: This phrase claims that Skinner believed humans are mere products of their environment, with no autonomy or control over their actions, as every behavior is strictly determined by external factors and the consequences they produce. It argues that people are guaranteed to repeat actions that yield rewards and will completely abandon those that result in negative consequences, as if they were programmed machines.
